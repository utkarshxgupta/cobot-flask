# cobot-flask
Deployed at http://co-bot-19.herokuapp.com/ 
> The bot deployed at heroku is an older version *(without the chatterbot library implemented)*, due to some error with spacy.

## Steps for running the project on your local machine

* Install python 2.8.0
* Install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file
* Open the terminal with admin access and run the following command -
  * `python -m spacy download en`
  * Admin access is needed for this command as it will link the en package to newer packages with changed names.
* After everything is done, you can run app.py and the chatbot will open!

You can reach out to me in case there are any problems in running the chatbot. I'll be happy to help.
